                    <p>
                        hi, i'm skeir boreal. a half korean they/fin dolphin from the u.s. i'm a dev/artist/musician that loves the early 2000s. my typing quirk is all lowercase with no period at the end of paragraphs
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i started making games when i was 11, originally on gamemaker studio 1 before moving to rpg maker xp, which is what i based most of the nokf codebase on. for a long time, i was trapped in tutorial hell and could rarely ever code without following one.
                        eventually, i made a roblox game where i started small and actually read the docs. that’s how i finally learned to program from scratch. i moved to unity for college and made a bunch of random games; the roblox studio experience helped a lot since the essentials translated perfectly. finally, i ended up using godot. i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon because, for the first time, i actually understand my entire codebase

                        i grew up in nearly every fandom including a certain one that crashed newgrounds twice *cough* homestuck. i used to be a diehard nintendo fan, and still love games like zelda botw and totk. i've also been apart of a lot of nsfw fandoms, and dream of making an nsfw smash bros esque game where a variety of nsfw game characters brawl and frick
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        in my free time i like playing vrchat, valorant, or obscure but exceptional rpgmaker games like <i>Space Funeral</i>. i enjoy playing piano, both real and virtual, even though i'm not that good at it. i also like watching anime since my dad raised me on it since i was a kid. i'll randomly obsess over cute and silly things like unico and labubus
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i mainly created this blog because social media makes me uncomfortable. it’s not that i have social anxiety, i just dislike all the negativity that comes with it. i’m honestly disappointed in how far people will go just because their opinions differ. eventually, i'd prefer to just pay someone to manage my socials for announcements and updates

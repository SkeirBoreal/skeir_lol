                    <h3>spring status dang</h3>
                    <p>
                        most of the previous winter stuff i was working on has pretty much been finished, but there's still a lack of finished character renders and spine rigs. i also gotta finish up some new textures for the village. i'm way further behind than i would like to be. some 'stuff' has happened lately to make me shutdown for a while, but i'm slowly picking myself back up. here's some new previews
                    <br><br>
                        yes there is other content, not just these 3 screenshots. this is just a quick sneak peek of some of them

                        kawanuki village 1 preview (ignore weird texture stuff it gets fixed through a gd shader)

                    <br><br>
                        i would like to give a reminder that pretty much all code for the game is complete, with just some bugs to work on. some stuff is disabled or not visible on the 0.1.3 build, but it's all there. hopefully by the time i find an artist these updates won't take nearly a year long :(

                    <p>
                        still not dead. some people asked me if i am. NOTF is still being worked on, just not as fast as i'd like. so far i have half of the kawanuki village done, all the music for the next update, as well as most character designs finished. thank you so much for the praise and reviews on the game, they've helped a lot
                    <br><br>
                        i keep drawing a blank whenever i start designing a map. whenever i have to do something as simple as coming up with a house, i spend a hot minute trying to figure out how it should look, and how it fits that character's personality. a while back i was suggested to do a hybrid japanese + hawaiian design for the nuki homes, which was a great suggestion! but in practice i got very lost with how that kind of design should look, so instead i decided to make some homes appear more hawaiian and others more like traditional japanese ones
                    <br><br>
                        at some point it would be nice to get help from more concept artists. having visual references are beyond helpful, even if they aren't 1:1 with the final product

                    <h3>summer status yay</h3>
                    <p>
                        if any of you are wondering NO i am not dead! i am still working on NOTF and i'm still very much living. i'm very sorry there hasn't been any updates or devlogs in such a long time. i want to make sure i do a good job polishing up the next update. i would also ideally like to avoid having to retcon a bunch of crap later on, as this is the first real story point in the game
                    <br><br>
                        i would like to avoid having any retcons and story plot holes. however, art is more than likely going to be revamped several times in the future. my art skills are still extremely minimal and i can NOT afford to pay anyone for art help. i heavily apologize if the art isn't up to anyone's standards during this next update

                    <h3>current state of my music and art skills</h3>
                    <p>
                        i haven't dedicated much time to properly practicing and learning music theory. the same goes for art; while i got a decent grasp of the fundamentals, i tend to forget them over time. i've been getting better at chord progressions, harmony (which i used to suck ass at), and more about using my DAW (FL Studio) in general. i haven't picked up much on art though, so my art skills are still the same as they were a year ago
                    <br><br>
                        nonetheless, i don't want to delay the development of NOTF any longer. programming has been challenging, yet enjoyable. this is partly because i understand how to achieve the results i want; i just need to debug and fine-tune things maybe 90% of the time. i'm not sure when i'll find the time to focus solely on music and art, but i know i'll lose plenty of sleep when i do

                    <h3>frutiger aero styled redesign</h3>
                    <p>
                        i absolutely adore and love the frutiger aero style, not just for nostalgia, but also because it just makes me focus on the content more. like the site theme? probably not, most people actually dislike the aero aesthetic, and that's perfectly fine. i'm actually planning on creating a small frutiger aero themed bar for VRChat. beautiful lighting included :3

                    <p>once most of my side projects as well as NOTF is out of the way i'll start posting a few things to youtube every now and then. this includes music, random dev blogs, helpful godot related advice, and more</p>

                    <p>this is the first post of the entire page, i'll probably forget about it years from now :o) there isn't too much to learn here so there's no point in an about page. i'll eventually add one if i have anything interesting worth sharing</p>
